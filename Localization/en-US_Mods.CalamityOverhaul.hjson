		Legend:
			'''

			The flames of war from a billion years ago have never truly been extinguished. 
			Like smoldering embers, they traverse the endless corridors of time, burning brightly even now.
			They are the remnants of the Twilight of the Gods, the afterglow of the universe’s ancient schism, the ceaseless echoes of existence and annihilation.

			The Radiant God, embodiment of galactic order, fell in the greatest rebellion the cosmos has ever witnessed.
			The divine body shattered like a collapsing star, scattering countless brilliant fragments across every corner of the galaxy.
			Those fragments became the seeds of life, the spark of knowledge, the cradle of miracles—and yet, 
			they also bore the stain of greed, destruction, and desecration.
			Mortals revere these remnants, calling them sacred relics; 
			yet the so-called miracles crafted from them are but crude imitations of the divine, the reckless hubris of those who do not know reverence.

			But among the forgotten ruins and the echoes of legend, there exists an artifact that transcends all relics. 
			It is no mere witness to the fall of the Supreme God; it was the very weapon that cast Him into eternal oblivion—a bow of legend.
			Once wreathed in the fury of heaven’s fire, 
			it loosed the fatal arrow that sundered the divine authority and extinguished the hubris of gods, bringing their ambitions to ruin.
			As the war ended, the bow too was claimed by the tides of time, buried in the endless shroud of mystery and myth.

			Yet now, the wheel of fate turns once more. 
			The fires of heaven reignite, and that god-slaying bow shall emerge anew amid the symphony of stars.
			Once more, it shall carve the annals of history in blood and stardust.

			Alina was once Terra’s sharpest warrior, wielding a blade of thunder to cleave through darkness,

			When the Supreme Deity passed judgment, her comrades, kin, oaths, and glory were reduced to ashes. 
			She witnessed firsthand how so-called justice trampled everything into dust, how order was merely a veil for the cruelest of destructions.  
			She no longer sought the light but reforged herself in the abyss. An ancient, 
			forbidden power consumed her soul, granting her strength beyond mortal comprehension.  
			Her armor became wreckage forged in the depths, her eyes burned with the remnants of thunder and darkness entwined. 
			She was no longer Terra’s guardian, but the storm itself—a vengeance that could not be stopped.  
			Her fury swept the battlefield like a howling tempest, her thunder tore through thrones and temples. 
			She fought not for justice, not for Terra, not for the gods.  
			She fought for vengeance, for annihilation—to make those who deemed themselves righteous understand the true meaning of fear.

			O shattered god, permit me to atone for my sins. 
			The war has sprawled across centuries, and I, a fugitive fleeing the grand civilization,
			eke out a meager existence on this desolate planet at the edge of the universe.
			Thousands of light-years away, the colossal war machines of conflict grind stars to dust.
			Savage and dreadful assaults erase light-years of stellar expanse in the blink of an eye, transforming it into a domain of silence.
			For countless centuries, this war has raged on. Now, the mighty civilization to which I belong teeters on the brink,
			and I shall become a cosmic sinner, the most disrespectful blasphemer.
			My flesh has decayed, my bones mirroring the wrinkles of passing ages. 
			I am on the verge of becoming one of the feeble machines I created. 
			Before that fate befalls me, may the gods grant me forgiveness and pardon my disrespect towards this supreme being. 
			Let me descend into the abyss of purgatory, enduring endless torment as my soul falls.
			Yet, for the sake of my civilization, for victory in this war spanning centuries, I must harness the fragmented power of this godly entity.
			To guide its mysterious force, I have no choice but to infuse its shattered divine form with the cold embrace of machinery.
			This is an inevitable sacrilege. For the continuity of civilization, for the triumph of war, 
			I must become the most devout follower of this supreme entity, the most disrespectful blasphemer in history.

		Legend:
			'''
			The eternal dungeon stretches across the land, its walls etched with the inscriptions and screams of ancient warriors. 
			Each stone is saturated with lingering malice, like chains of the damned, binding it to the endless darkness at time’s end.  
			These warriors were once the blades of their king, waging war across the realms. 
			Their swords had illuminated countless battlefields, their blood forged the towering empire. 
			Their loyalty was as enduring as the stars, their conviction as unyielding as iron.  
			Yet, when the wars ceased, and the Demonlord’s banners were torn asunder at the king’s feet, 
			the moment peace descended, the king decreed their consignment to the abyss.  
			“We betrayed not, yet the king has betrayed us!” The anguished wails of the damned tore through the void, piercing the silence of eternity. 
			Their noble spirits did not return to the dust but were imprisoned in the void’s chasm, condemned as witnesses to eternal night.  
			The ceaseless lamentations transformed into a silent accusation, one that reached the furthest ends of the stars.  
			It is said the king, in fear of their unyielding loyalty and the inferno of their wrath, 
			heeded the whispers of the Demonlord’s sorcerers, choosing to consign these warriors to the shadows of history.  
			But malice, like a tide, has twisted the dungeon’s reality. Their suffering has shaken the barriers of time and space, weaving a prophecy of vengeance:  
			“The Demonlord shall return; the void shall be torn asunder, and our wrath shall consume all!”  
			When Terra once more faces the brink of annihilation, these restless dead will rise from the darkness. 
			Their blades will no longer fight for the glory of an empire but for the judgment of the betrayer.  
			Glory and loyalty are long since obliterated—only the flames of vengeance remain, destined to engulf all.

				Rolename1: ???
				Rolename2: Halibut
				Line0: Sir... your fishing technique... leaves something to be desired.
				Line1: You may call me Dr. Halibut.
				Line2: Or, just Halibut is fine.
				Line3: Thanks to your hook, I was pulled out of that silent, dead water.
				Line4: If it weren't for you, I'd probably have been stuck in a system crash... until I truly expired.
				Line5: This fish should have been your catch. Now, it's a gift to mark our meeting.
				Line6: ......
				Line7: You're wondering why I'm here, aren't you.
				Line8: I was a professor at the Sulphurous Sea University, Department of Abyssal Research.
				Line9: A few years ago, we organized an 'Abyssal Ecological Sampling Project.'
				Line10: I was the only one who made it back.
				Line11: At the bottom of the abyss, we encountered... an existence that cannot be understood.
				Line12: It couldn't have been a living thing, nor something that could be 'killed.' It was more like... terror, in its conceptual form.
				Line13: As I fled, I found an eye beneath a coral tree.
				Line14: On pure survival instinct, I swallowed it.
				Line15: Using the power of that eye, I opened a domain... and tore a fissure in the abyss to escape.
				Line16: After that, my memory blurs... I fell into a deep slumber, until you fished me up.
				Line17: You look like a Terrarian.
				Line18: If you'll have me, take me with you.
				Line19: I will help you conquer this land.
				Line20: In exchange... help me solve this... 'revival' problem with the eyes inside me.
				Line21: If there are no objections, let's begin by... studying this fish.
			}

			EyeOfCthulhuGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: That giant eye dragged your movements into slow motion... I thought you were just striking a pose.
				L1: We've entered the 'Watched Stage.' This means more... dramatic messes are on the way.
				L2: I found this in the eye's great maw. Here, a Cthulhu Fish. Much like its namesake, it doesn't really follow logic.
				L3: Be careful with it. It'll make you think you've opened your third eye. In reality, it's just a stimulant in your bloodstream.
				L4: I'm curious if you'll start winking at the moon now.
			}

			KingSlimeGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: That blue blob... a 'slime,' you call it? It looked more like... solidified emotion.
				L1: A clumsy attempt by matter to gain self-awareness and evolve, perhaps.
				L2: Please, take this. A Slimefish. Don't squeeze it. Its feelings might explode.
				L3: Have you ever tried to make soup from one of these?
				L4: I mean... yes, we make soup at the bottom of the sea. The sea floor even has... well, seas within the sea.
			}

			QueenBeeGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				R2: ???
				L0: I almost got a faceful of honey back there.
				L1: Still, I managed to pull a fish out of a honey puddle on the ground.
				L2: Here, a fresh... and still-warm Honeyfish.
				L3: I think it would be perfect for a sweet and sour dish.
			}

			SkeletronGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Now that was a significant amount of calcium.
				L1: Its cranial structure reminded me of a runaway psychic construct.
				L2: Let my gun barrel cool down. I found a fish around here in the meantime.
				L3: Look, a 'Skeletron Fish.' They say the phosphorus inside makes night-fishers contemplate their existence.
				L4: Let's move. More... 'abstract' bones await.
			}

			AquaticScourgeGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: It reminds me of the less-friendly neighbors from my hometown... though this one was quite amicable. Used to be the head of security at Sulphurous Sea University. Always said hello.
				L1: The Sulphurous Sea is an interesting place. Every creature there asks the same question: 'Why am I still alive?'
				L2: A Prismfish. Its scales refract colors you've never seen. Mainly because they shouldn't exist.
				L3: Staring at it will reboot your visual system. Like a forced update, but more painful.
				L4: Finally, use it in dim light. Otherwise, you'll feel... high.
			}

			BrimstoneElementalGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Her just standing there was like a burning speech. Good thing we managed to shut her up.
				L1: Some elementals aren't created. They're just... oddities... that seep out of the world's cracks.
				L2: An Obsidianfish. A product of instantly cooled lava. Its scales are harder than the grudges festering in hell.
				L3: Careful, it might spontaneously combust in your hand. Not physically... emotionally.
				L4: After all, some kinds of anger are contagious.
			}

			CalamitasCloneGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A cheap shadow. Reminds me of the genetic monstrosities I used to cook up in my trench back in university. In any case, the one who made this has terrible taste.
				L1: I have a bad feeling. The real terror is still waiting... deeper. It's even getting closer.
				L2: Back to business. A Brimstone Fish, picked from her embers. You can still hear it muttering nonsense if you hold it close.
				L3: If you start to understand what it's saying... well, congratulations. You've taken the first step into madness.
				L4: But don't worry. Madness is just another form of clarity, seen from a different angle.
			}

			CrabulonGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: That mushroom-like... being? Is it wisdom or just pure instinct hidden under its cap?
				L1: Did you know mycelial networks can transmit information? Maybe it was calling for help.
				L2: This is a Fungifish. I barely caught it among the spores it was releasing.
				L3: Don't worry, these spores won't turn a human into a fungus... probably.
				L4: But if you suddenly get the urge to put down roots in a dark, damp place, do let me know.
			}

			CryogenGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A frozen soul... a temperature so low that time itself wants to lie down and rest.
				L1: You know, the end of cold isn't death. It's a state of eternal stillness.
				L2: A Cryo-minnow, thawed from the ice shards. It's still holding the pose it was frozen in.
				L3: They say eating it cools your blood, makes your thoughts exceptionally clear.
				L4: Eat too many, and you might just become an ice sculpture.
			}

			DevourerOfGodsGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Devourer of Gods... a cosmic serpent that dines on deities. Its appetite is as infinite as its ambition.
				L1: You know what they say: when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back. But this thing doesn't just gaze. It wants you for a snack.
				L2: A Neon Tetra. It floated out of a void rift. The light it emits isn't from this dimension.
				L3: Looking at it makes your brain try to comprehend colors it shouldn't. It's a... unique experience.
				L4: If you start seeing new colors, congratulations. If you start *smelling* colors, you need a rest.
			}

			GolemGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A pile of moving rocks. Legacy of an ancient civilization... or perhaps, proof of their failure.
				L1: It might be guarding something. Or just repeating a program that lost its meaning long ago.
				L2: A Rockfish, dug from the temple's foundation. Its density makes me question my life.
				L3: I tried to boil it once. My pot surrendered first.
				L4: ...Some things exist just to make us realize that not all problems need to be solved.
			}

			HiveMindGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A collective consciousness made of corruption... what a disgusting concept.
				L1: Its thought process must be... unique. Countless rotten fragments pieced together into a single, twisted whole.
				L2: Here, a Rotfish. Pulled it from that pile of carrion. Don't ask how.
				L3: It smells like seafood that's been left in the sun for three days.
				L4: But they say it lets you... resonate with the corruption. That just sounds wrong.
			}

			LeviathanGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The ocean's tyrant... and her little sidekick who's always following her. Some friendships transcend species. And logic.
				L1: You know, what lives in the deepest trenches isn't fear, it's loneliness. They're just looking for company.
				L2: A Tropic-cuda, pulled from a deep-sea vortex. It looks ordinary, which is precisely what's suspicious about it.
				L3: The more mundane the exterior, the more extraordinary the past.
				L4: Just like us.
			}

			MoonLordGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Lord of the Moon, ha! Or, *formerly*. Now just a floating pile of eyeballs and gore.
				L1: We didn't just save the world; we closed a door that was never meant to be opened correctly.
				L2: I caught a Cloudfish. It floated down from a crack in the sky. Feels weightless in my hand.
				L3: They say it lets you see the future... but you've already rewritten that future.
				L4: We just proved that even gods can bleed.
			}

			PerforatorGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A pile of drilling flesh-worms... this creature's existence is a challenge to biology.
				L1: Their blood has a strange viscosity, like some kind of living metal.
				L2: Found this in the wreckage. A Gore-fish. It's still wriggling.
				L3: Don't be scared by its looks, even if it looks like it crawled out of a nightmare.
				L4: At least it won't crawl into your ear while you sleep... probably.
			}

			PlaguebringerGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Plaguebringer... a mechanical bee carrying a bioweapon. Who designed this? A real bastard, daring to enslave bees.
				L1: A virus doesn't care about right or wrong. It just wants to survive. Like us, only more direct.
				L2: A Jewel-fish. It was infected and miraculously recovered. Its immune system is more experienced than you are.
				L3: They say eating it boosts resistance. Sounds like another way of saying 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
				L4: But since you just walked out of a plague-hive, this little risk should be nothing.
			}

			PlanteraGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A flower... if 'flower' is the word for a man-eating vine conglomerate.
				L1: The jungle's rage, grown in plant form. Nature's revenge is never rational.
				L2: A Twin-Cod. It has two heads. The jungle is like a land-ocean; things here don't need a reason to grow extra parts.
				L3: They say two heads mean twice the wisdom, but they just look like they're arguing over which way to swim.
				L4: Like 'diet' and 'appetite.' Always fighting. My appetite always wins, though.
			}

			ProvidenceGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Profaned Goddess... a contradiction of faith and flame. Quite pitiful.
				L1: We didn't just extinguish a holy flame, but the embers of an entire era.
				L2: A Demon-Hell Fish, reborn from her ashes. Its temperature is permanently fixed at 'just hot enough not to burn you.'
				L3: That precise control makes me suspect... maybe she just wanted to be understood.
				L4: But the line between understanding and war is only one attack away.
			}

			SlimeGodGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Three slimes... or, a fractured divinity? This dualistic existence is... interesting.
				L1: Corruption and Crimson. The eternal conflict of this world. And we just proved that conflict can be 'resolved.'
				L2: A Variegated Lardfish. Scooped from the goo. Don't ask about the name.
				L3: Its color changes with the observer's mood. Or perhaps, it's mimicking your inner chaos.
				L4: Stare too long, and you might start to wonder which side you're really on.
			}

			SupremeCalamitasGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Supreme Calamitas... an avenger. The most powerful magic-wielder of the last century.
				L1: What we just did... did we end a legend, or create a new one?
				L2: A Princessfish, born from her embers. It has a conflicting grace, like a flower blooming in ruins.
				L3: They say it shows you the person you most want to be... but that version is often the least like yourself.
				L4: You're nearing the peak of Terrarian power. From here on... it's a long way down.
			}

			WallOfFleshGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A wall of flesh and bone... this world's creator must have had some peculiar ideas.
				L1: You just broke some kind of balance. Feel that? The world's pulse is quickening.
				L2: Found this Hungering Fish in the remains. It looks eternally starved.
				L3: Just like that wall. Always chasing, always consuming.
				L4: Welcome to 'Hard Mode'... though I didn't think it was 'easy' before.
			}

			YharonGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Jungle Dragon... no, the World-Burning Dragon. It burns not with flesh, but with obsession.
				L1: A loyalty so pure it would burn itself to ash for its master... reminds me of the fish schools that guard the coral reefs back home.
				L2: A Scarlet Tigerfish. Just caught it. I'm quite fond of its stripes.
				L3: Holding it, you feel a scorching resolve. That is the temperature of a warrior.
				L4: You defeated that dragon, but I have to wonder... in the moment it fell, did it finally find... release?
