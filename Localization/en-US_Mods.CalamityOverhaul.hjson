		Legend:
			'''

			The flames of war from a billion years ago have never truly been extinguished. 
			Like smoldering embers, they traverse the endless corridors of time, burning brightly even now.
			They are the remnants of the Twilight of the Gods, the afterglow of the universe’s ancient schism, the ceaseless echoes of existence and annihilation.

			The Radiant God, embodiment of galactic order, fell in the greatest rebellion the cosmos has ever witnessed.
			The divine body shattered like a collapsing star, scattering countless brilliant fragments across every corner of the galaxy.
			Those fragments became the seeds of life, the spark of knowledge, the cradle of miracles—and yet, 
			they also bore the stain of greed, destruction, and desecration.
			Mortals revere these remnants, calling them sacred relics; 
			yet the so-called miracles crafted from them are but crude imitations of the divine, the reckless hubris of those who do not know reverence.

			But among the forgotten ruins and the echoes of legend, there exists an artifact that transcends all relics. 
			It is no mere witness to the fall of the Supreme God; it was the very weapon that cast Him into eternal oblivion—a bow of legend.
			Once wreathed in the fury of heaven’s fire, 
			it loosed the fatal arrow that sundered the divine authority and extinguished the hubris of gods, bringing their ambitions to ruin.
			As the war ended, the bow too was claimed by the tides of time, buried in the endless shroud of mystery and myth.

			Yet now, the wheel of fate turns once more. 
			The fires of heaven reignite, and that god-slaying bow shall emerge anew amid the symphony of stars.
			Once more, it shall carve the annals of history in blood and stardust.

			'''

			In the shadowed realms of Terra, the once radiant warrior goddess, Alina,
			now finds herself plunged into an endless abyss of chaos and despair, emerging as the whispered harbinger known as the Storm Goddess.
			Once, she stood as an unmatched warrior on the continent, her fearless courage and razor-sharp blade commanding a serene sky like lightning.
			However, the shadows of fate began to creep beneath her feet. In the twilight clash between light and darkness, as heaven crumbled and darkness consumed the remnants, 
			the Storm Goddess bore witness to the cruelty of the Supreme Deity. The arrogant god stripped her of comrades, kin, and obliterated all she had once sheltered.
			The sins of the Supreme Deity cast doubts upon her once unwavering faith in justice, leading her to descend into the unfathomable abyss of corruption.
			As the embers of war settled, Alina returned to Terra, but she was no longer the valiant warrior of yore.
			The internal agony and boundless despair propelled her to forsake the lofty beliefs she once held, seeking a new wellspring of power. 
			In a gruesome ritual, she obtained the forbidden blessing – an influx of boundless power, paid for with the eternal corruption of her soul.
			Now, the Storm Goddess stands as an emblem of abyssal descent, her armor adorned with obsidian akin to a night sky, 
			eyes shimmering with the corruptive radiance. The chaotic currents surge, projecting malice towards Terra. Her blade,
			a thunderous force in the obsidian night, dances with arcs of annihilative power. No longer fighting for justice, she has become a force set on obliterating all.
			Though she retains the martial prowess of yore, she is now the nemesis of Terra, scorned by countless tongues. 
			The Storm Goddess cruelly embarks on a solitary and corruptive journey, lingering in the shadows. Her very existence mocks the bygone glory of Terra,
			a tempest consuming every vestige of hope.
			As a fallen star plunges into the abyss, she blossoms in the boundless darkness, carrying the universe's sorrow and destruction."

			O shattered god, permit me to atone for my sins. 
			The war has sprawled across centuries, and I, a fugitive fleeing the grand civilization,
			eke out a meager existence on this desolate planet at the edge of the universe.
			Thousands of light-years away, the colossal war machines of conflict grind stars to dust.
			Savage and dreadful assaults erase light-years of stellar expanse in the blink of an eye, transforming it into a domain of silence.
			For countless centuries, this war has raged on. Now, the mighty civilization to which I belong teeters on the brink,
			and I shall become a cosmic sinner, the most disrespectful blasphemer.
			My flesh has decayed, my bones mirroring the wrinkles of passing ages. 
			I am on the verge of becoming one of the feeble machines I created. 
			Before that fate befalls me, may the gods grant me forgiveness and pardon my disrespect towards this supreme being. 
			Let me descend into the abyss of purgatory, enduring endless torment as my soul falls.
			Yet, for the sake of my civilization, for victory in this war spanning centuries, I must harness the fragmented power of this godly entity.
			To guide its mysterious force, I have no choice but to infuse its shattered divine form with the cold embrace of machinery.
			This is an inevitable sacrilege. For the continuity of civilization, for the triumph of war, 
			I must become the most devout follower of this supreme entity, the most disrespectful blasphemer in history.

		Legend:
			'''
			The eternal dungeon stretches across the land, its walls etched with the inscriptions and screams of ancient warriors. 
			Each stone is saturated with lingering malice, like chains of the damned, binding it to the endless darkness at time’s end.  
			These warriors were once the blades of their king, waging war across the realms. 
			Their swords had illuminated countless battlefields, their blood forged the towering empire. 
			Their loyalty was as enduring as the stars, their conviction as unyielding as iron.  
			Yet, when the wars ceased, and the Demonlord’s banners were torn asunder at the king’s feet, 
			the moment peace descended, the king decreed their consignment to the abyss.  
			“We betrayed not, yet the king has betrayed us!” The anguished wails of the damned tore through the void, piercing the silence of eternity. 
			Their noble spirits did not return to the dust but were imprisoned in the void’s chasm, condemned as witnesses to eternal night.  
			The ceaseless lamentations transformed into a silent accusation, one that reached the furthest ends of the stars.  
			It is said the king, in fear of their unyielding loyalty and the inferno of their wrath, 
			heeded the whispers of the Demonlord’s sorcerers, choosing to consign these warriors to the shadows of history.  
			But malice, like a tide, has twisted the dungeon’s reality. Their suffering has shaken the barriers of time and space, weaving a prophecy of vengeance:  
			“The Demonlord shall return; the void shall be torn asunder, and our wrath shall consume all!”  
			When Terra once more faces the brink of annihilation, these restless dead will rise from the darkness. 
			Their blades will no longer fight for the glory of an empire but for the judgment of the betrayer.  
			Glory and loyalty are long since obliterated—only the flames of vengeance remain, destined to engulf all.

		Greeting0: I enjoy the atmosphere in the Abyss. Those giant creatures are actually very friendly, they’re just really shy, easily startled, and... a bit evil...
		Greeting1: Ah, welcome! Don't be surprised by my monocle and top hat. I’m Dr. Bigflatfish, a professor at Sulfur Sea University! Knowledge and elegance, both are essential.
		Greeting2: You may not have heard of Sulfur Sea University, but there, I’ve studied marine biology and abyssal botany. Oh, and I also showed off a bit in fishing competitions, winning two championships.
		Greeting3: Can a flounder attend university? Of course! The underwater world hides many corners of wisdom. Don’t let my leisurely swimming fool you, I always have a book in hand.
		Greeting4: Do you like my top hat? It’s quite stylish, isn’t it? Actually, it’s my lucky charm from the fishing competitions. It witnessed my glorious moments of winning twice!
		Greeting5: Abyssal botany is no small matter. Don’t underestimate those floating algae. Their stories are as profound as the starry sky. If you’re interested, I’d be happy to share some with you.
		Greeting6: Oh, as a fish, I’m no simple creature! Academic research, fishing contests, deep-sea adventures... I’m passionate about everything. Right now, I’m happy to chat with you.
		Greeting7: The title of professor is not just for show. Even sharks praise my knowledge! And, of course, my top hat is quite popular as well.
		Greeting8: ‘Knowledge is power,’ I firmly believe in that. Whether it’s earning my doctorate or dominating fishing competitions, it all relies on my rich brain and flexible fins!
		Greeting9: The underwater world is vast and unimaginably exciting. If you have time, come with me and explore the mysterious deep-sea plants. I can be your guide!
		Greeting10: Hey, sometimes even I can’t help but think: a flounder wearing a monocle, discussing underwater knowledge, it’s truly a wonder. But knowledge, anyone can have it, right?
		Greeting11: Every time I see the surprised expressions of land creatures, it’s quite amusing. There are many wise marine creatures, and I’m just one of the fish who’s ‘dressed up’ a bit.
		Greeting12: In addition to academic research, I enjoy observing the daily life underwater. The corals, schools of fish, and occasionally passing sea turtles, every scene is as beautiful as a natural painting.
		Greeting13: Winning two championships is nice, but what truly makes me proud is my love for knowledge. It’s because of this passion that I’m able to leave my small legend in the underwater world!
