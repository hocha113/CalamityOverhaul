		Legend:
			'''

			The flames of war from a billion years ago have never truly been extinguished. 
			Like smoldering embers, they traverse the endless corridors of time, burning brightly even now.
			They are the remnants of the Twilight of the Gods, the afterglow of the universe’s ancient schism, the ceaseless echoes of existence and annihilation.

			The Radiant God, embodiment of galactic order, fell in the greatest rebellion the cosmos has ever witnessed.
			The divine body shattered like a collapsing star, scattering countless brilliant fragments across every corner of the galaxy.
			Those fragments became the seeds of life, the spark of knowledge, the cradle of miracles—and yet, 
			they also bore the stain of greed, destruction, and desecration.
			Mortals revere these remnants, calling them sacred relics; 
			yet the so-called miracles crafted from them are but crude imitations of the divine, the reckless hubris of those who do not know reverence.

			But among the forgotten ruins and the echoes of legend, there exists an artifact that transcends all relics. 
			It is no mere witness to the fall of the Supreme God; it was the very weapon that cast Him into eternal oblivion—a bow of legend.
			Once wreathed in the fury of heaven’s fire, 
			it loosed the fatal arrow that sundered the divine authority and extinguished the hubris of gods, bringing their ambitions to ruin.
			As the war ended, the bow too was claimed by the tides of time, buried in the endless shroud of mystery and myth.

			Yet now, the wheel of fate turns once more. 
			The fires of heaven reignite, and that god-slaying bow shall emerge anew amid the symphony of stars.
			Once more, it shall carve the annals of history in blood and stardust.

			Alina was once Terra’s sharpest warrior, wielding a blade of thunder to cleave through darkness,

			When the Supreme Deity passed judgment, her comrades, kin, oaths, and glory were reduced to ashes. 
			She witnessed firsthand how so-called justice trampled everything into dust, how order was merely a veil for the cruelest of destructions.  
			She no longer sought the light but reforged herself in the abyss. An ancient, 
			forbidden power consumed her soul, granting her strength beyond mortal comprehension.  
			Her armor became wreckage forged in the depths, her eyes burned with the remnants of thunder and darkness entwined. 
			She was no longer Terra’s guardian, but the storm itself—a vengeance that could not be stopped.  
			Her fury swept the battlefield like a howling tempest, her thunder tore through thrones and temples. 
			She fought not for justice, not for Terra, not for the gods.  
			She fought for vengeance, for annihilation—to make those who deemed themselves righteous understand the true meaning of fear.

			O shattered god, permit me to atone for my sins. 
			The war has sprawled across centuries, and I, a fugitive fleeing the grand civilization,
			eke out a meager existence on this desolate planet at the edge of the universe.
			Thousands of light-years away, the colossal war machines of conflict grind stars to dust.
			Savage and dreadful assaults erase light-years of stellar expanse in the blink of an eye, transforming it into a domain of silence.
			For countless centuries, this war has raged on. Now, the mighty civilization to which I belong teeters on the brink,
			and I shall become a cosmic sinner, the most disrespectful blasphemer.
			My flesh has decayed, my bones mirroring the wrinkles of passing ages. 
			I am on the verge of becoming one of the feeble machines I created. 
			Before that fate befalls me, may the gods grant me forgiveness and pardon my disrespect towards this supreme being. 
			Let me descend into the abyss of purgatory, enduring endless torment as my soul falls.
			Yet, for the sake of my civilization, for victory in this war spanning centuries, I must harness the fragmented power of this godly entity.
			To guide its mysterious force, I have no choice but to infuse its shattered divine form with the cold embrace of machinery.
			This is an inevitable sacrilege. For the continuity of civilization, for the triumph of war, 
			I must become the most devout follower of this supreme entity, the most disrespectful blasphemer in history.

		Legend:
			'''
			The eternal dungeon stretches across the land, its walls etched with the inscriptions and screams of ancient warriors. 
			Each stone is saturated with lingering malice, like chains of the damned, binding it to the endless darkness at time’s end.  
			These warriors were once the blades of their king, waging war across the realms. 
			Their swords had illuminated countless battlefields, their blood forged the towering empire. 
			Their loyalty was as enduring as the stars, their conviction as unyielding as iron.  
			Yet, when the wars ceased, and the Demonlord’s banners were torn asunder at the king’s feet, 
			the moment peace descended, the king decreed their consignment to the abyss.  
			“We betrayed not, yet the king has betrayed us!” The anguished wails of the damned tore through the void, piercing the silence of eternity. 
			Their noble spirits did not return to the dust but were imprisoned in the void’s chasm, condemned as witnesses to eternal night.  
			The ceaseless lamentations transformed into a silent accusation, one that reached the furthest ends of the stars.  
			It is said the king, in fear of their unyielding loyalty and the inferno of their wrath, 
			heeded the whispers of the Demonlord’s sorcerers, choosing to consign these warriors to the shadows of history.  
			But malice, like a tide, has twisted the dungeon’s reality. Their suffering has shaken the barriers of time and space, weaving a prophecy of vengeance:  
			“The Demonlord shall return; the void shall be torn asunder, and our wrath shall consume all!”  
			When Terra once more faces the brink of annihilation, these restless dead will rise from the darkness. 
			Their blades will no longer fight for the glory of an empire but for the judgment of the betrayer.  
			Glory and loyalty are long since obliterated—only the flames of vengeance remain, destined to engulf all.

				Rolename1: ???
				Rolename2: Halibut
				Line0: Sir... your fishing technique could still use a little improvement.
				Line1: You can call me Dr. Halibut.
				Line2: Or just Halibut, if you prefer.
				Line3: Thanks to your hook, I was dragged out of that lifeless sea.
				Line4: Without you, I’d probably still be stuck in a frozen loop—until I truly died.
				Line5: That fish you caught was meant to be yours... consider it our first meeting gift.
				Line6: ...
				Line7: You’re wondering why I’m here, aren’t you?
				Line8: I used to be a professor at the Sulphur Sea University, in the Department of Abyssal Studies.
				Line9: A few years ago, we organized a project “The Abyssal Ecosystem Survey”
				Line10: In the end... I was the only one who returned.
				Line11: Down in the depths, we encountered something... incomprehensible.
				Line12: It wasn’t alive, nor was it something that could be “killed.” It was... terror given form—an idea that refused to die.
				Line13: During my escape, I found an eye beneath a coral tree.
				Line14: Acting on pure instinct, I swallowed it.
				Line15: With its power, I opened a domain—tore open a rift, and fled the Abyss.
				Line16: After that... everything went blank. I must have fallen asleep, until you fished me up.
				Line17: You look like a Terrarian.
				Line18: If you’re willing—take me with you.
				Line19: I’ll help you conquer this land.
				Line20: In return... help me suppress the resurgence of the eyes within me.
				Line21: If that’s settled, then let’s start by studying this fish, shall we?
			}

			EyeOfCthulhuGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: That giant eye dragged your movements into slow motion... I thought you were just striking a pose.
				L1: Congratulations, you've entered the 'Watched Stage.' This means... more dramatic messes are on the way.
				L2: Take this, it's a Cthulhu Fish. Just like its namesake, it doesn't really follow logic.
				L3: Be careful with it. It'll make you think you've opened your third eye, but really, it's just a stimulant in your bloodstream.
				L4: I'm curious if you'll start winking at the moon now.
			}

			KingSlimeGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: That blue blob... you call it a slime? It looked more like the physical manifestation of an emotion.
				L1: Perhaps a clumsy attempt by matter to gain self-awareness and evolve. A shame it has no 'memory'.
				L2: Here you go, a Slimefish. Don't squeeze it, its feelings might just explode.
				L3: Have you ever tried making soup with one of these creatures?
				L4: I mean... yes, we can make soup at the bottom of the sea. The sea floor even has... well, sea.
			}

			QueenBeeGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				R2: ???
				L0: For a second there, I thought I was about to get a faceful of honeycomb.
				L1: Anyway, I managed to pull a fish out of a pile of honey on the ground.
				L2: Here, a fresh and still-warm Honeyfish.
				L3: I think it would be perfect for a sweet and sour dish.
			}

			SkeletronGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Now that was a whole lot of calcium!
				L1: The cranial structure of that thing... it reminded me of a runaway psychic construct.
				L2: Let my gun barrel cool down. I found a fish around here in the meantime.
				L3: See? A 'Skeletron Fish.' They say the phosphorus inside makes people who fish at night contemplate the meaning of life.
				L4: Let's go. There are even more 'abstract' bones waiting for you up ahead.
			}

			AquaticScourgeGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0:
					'''
					It reminds me of the less-friendly neighbors from my hometown. This one was surprisingly pleasant, though. 
					It used to be the head of security at the Sulphurous Sea University where I worked. Always said hello.
					'''
				L1: The Sulphurous Sea is an interesting place. Every creature there is asking the same question: 'Why am I still alive?'
				L2: A Prismfish. Its scales refract colors you've never seen before, mainly because they shouldn't exist.
				L3: Staring at it will reboot your visual system. It's kind of like a forced software update, but more painful.
				L4: Lastly, try not to look at it in bright light. Otherwise, you'll feel like you're tripping.
			}

			BrimstoneElementalGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The embodiment of brimstone and fire. Her very existence was a burning speech, but I think we managed to shut her up.
				L1: Some elementals aren't created. They're just rage seeping out of the world's cracks.
				L2: An Obsidianfish, a product of instantly cooled lava. Its scales are harder than hatred.
				L3: Be careful, it might combust in your hands. Not physically, but conceptually.
				L4: After all, some kinds of anger are contagious.
			}

			CalamitasCloneGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A shadow... but shadows shouldn't have their own will. Unless the original has become so powerful it's starting to fracture.
				L1: You didn't defeat her, just her echo. The real terror is still waiting in the depths.
				L2: A Brimstone Fish, extracted from the embers of Calamitas. It whispers secrets in your hand that were never meant to be heard.
				L3: If you start to understand what it's saying... congratulations, you've taken the first step into madness.
				L4: But don't worry. Madness is just another kind of clarity, seen from a different angle.
			}

			CrabulonGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: That mushroom-like... creature? I wonder if there's wisdom or just pure instinct hidden under its cap.
				L1: Did you know that a mushroom's mycelial network can transmit information? Maybe it was calling for help just now.
				L2: This is a Fungi-fish, extracted from the spores it emits.
				L3: Don't worry, the spores won't turn you into a fungus... probably.
				L4: But if you suddenly get the urge to put down roots in a dark, damp place, let me know.
			}

			CryogenGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A frozen soul... a temperature so low that time itself wants to lie down and rest.
				L1: You know, the end of cold isn't death. It's a state of eternal stillness.
				L2: A Cryo-minnow, thawed from shards of its ice. It's still holding the pose it was frozen in.
				L3: They say eating it will lower your blood temperature and make your thoughts exceptionally clear.
				L4: Just don't eat too many, unless you actually want to become an ice sculpture.
			}

			DevourerOfGodsGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Devourer of Gods... a cosmic serpent that dines on deities. Its appetite is as infinite as its ambition.
				L1: You know what they say: when you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes back. But this thing doesn't just gaze, it tries to eat you for a snack.
				L2: A Void-fin, it drifted out of a dimensional rift. The light it gives off isn't from around here.
				L3: Looking at it makes your brain try to comprehend colors it shouldn't. It's a... unique experience.
				L4: If you start seeing new colors, congratulations. If you start smelling colors, it's time for a break.
			}

			GolemGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A moving pile of stones. A legacy of an ancient civilization, or perhaps, proof of their failure.
				L1: Was it guarding something? Or just repeating a program that lost its meaning long ago?
				L2: A Rockfish, dug out from the temple's foundation. It's so dense I'm starting to think gravity is broken.
				L3: I tried to boil it once. My pot surrendered first.
				L4: ...Some things exist just to make you realize that not all problems need to be solved.
			}

			HiveMindGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A collective consciousness made of corruption... a truly distasteful concept.
				L1: Its way of thinking must be peculiar. Countless rotten fragments pieced together into a single twisted whole.
				L2: Here, a Rotfish. Pulled it from that pile of carrion. Don't ask me how.
				L3: It smells like seafood that's been forgotten in the sun for three days.
				L4: But they say it allows you to... resonate with the corruption. That just sounds wrong.
			}

			LeviathanGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The ocean's tyrant... and that little sidekick who's always with her. Some friendships transcend species, and also logic.
				L1: You know, what lives in the deepest trenches isn't fear, it's loneliness. They were just looking for company.
				L2: A Tropic-cuda, fished out of a deep-sea vortex. It looks normal, which is precisely what makes it so suspicious.
				L3: The more ordinary the appearance, the more extraordinary the past.
				L4: Just like us.
			}

			MoonLordGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Lord of the Moon, ha! Or, formerly. Now it's just a floating pile of eyeballs and gore.
				L1: We didn't just save the world; we closed a door that was never meant to be opened in the first place.
				L2: A Cloudfish, it floated down from a crack in the sky. It feels weightless in your hand.
				L3: They say it can let you see the future... but you've already rewritten that future.
				L4: We just proved that even gods can bleed.
			}

			PerforatorGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A pile of flesh worms that drill holes... the existence of this creature is a challenge to biology itself.
				L1: Their blood has a peculiar viscosity, like some kind of living metal.
				L2: Found this in the wreckage. A Gore-fish. It's still wriggling.
				L3: Don't let its appearance frighten you, even if it looks like it crawled out of a nightmare.
				L4: At least it won't crawl into your ear while you sleep... probably.
			}

			PlaguebringerGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Plaguebringer... a mechanical bee carrying a bioweapon. Who designed this? Must be a real bastard, daring to enslave bees.
				L1: A virus doesn't care about right or wrong. It just wants to survive. Just like us, but with more direct methods.
				L2: An Amethyst Fish. It was infected and then miraculously cured. Its immune system is more experienced than you are.
				L3: People say eating it boosts your resistance. I think that's just another way of saying 'what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.'
				L4: But since you just walked out of a plague-ridden beehive, a little risk like this should be nothing.
			}

			PlanteraGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A flower... if the word 'flower' can be used to describe a man-eating aggregate of vines.
				L1: The jungle's rage grows in plant form. Nature's revenge is never rational.
				L2: A Twin-headed Cod. It has two heads. The jungle is like the ocean of the land; things don't need a reason to grow extra parts.
				L3: They say two heads mean twice the wisdom, but it looks like they're just arguing about which way to swim.
				L4: Like diet and appetite. Always fighting, but neither one can ever convince the other.
			}

			ProvidenceGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Profaned Goddess... a contradiction made of faith and flame. What was she protecting? Or was she just burning?
				L1: You didn't just extinguish a holy flame, but the embers of an entire era.
				L2: A Demon-Hell Fish, reborn from her ashes. Its temperature is permanently fixed at 'just hot enough not to burn you.'
				L3: That level of precise control makes me suspect that maybe she just wanted to be understood.
				L4: But the line between understanding and war is only one attack away.
			}

			SlimeGodGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Three slimes, er, or a single fractured divinity? This kind of dualistic existence is quite interesting.
				L1: Corruption and Crimson, like the eternal conflict of this world. And you just proved that conflict can be 'resolved.'
				L2: This is a Variegated Lardfish, scooped from that pile of goo. Don't ask me why it's called that.
				L3: Its color changes based on the observer's mood. Or rather, it mimics your inner chaos.
				L4: If you stare at it for too long, you might start to wonder which side you're really on.
			}

			SupremeCalamitasGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: Supreme Calamitas... she is the avatar of vengeance, a perfect weapon forged by betrayal.
				L1: What we just did... did we end a legend? Or create a new one?
				L2: A Princess Fish, born from the embers of Calamity. It carries a conflicted grace, like a flower blooming in ruins.
				L3: They say it shows you the person you most want to be. But that version of you is often the one least like yourself.
				L4: Congratulations. You're standing at the apex of power. From here on out... it's a long way down.
			}

			WallOfFleshGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: A wall made of flesh and bone... the creator of this world must have had some peculiar ideas.
				L1: You've just shattered some kind of balance. Feel that? The world's pulse is starting to quicken.
				L2: I found this Hungering Fish in the remains. It looks like it can never be full.
				L3: Just like that wall. Always chasing, always consuming.
				L4: Welcome to 'Hardmode'... though I don't think it was exactly easy before.
			}

			YharonGift: {
				R1: Halibut
				L0: The Jungle Dragon... no, the World-Burning Dragon. It burns not with flesh, but with obsession.
				L1: A loyalty so pure it would burn itself to ash for its master. It reminds me of the schools of fish that guard coral reefs back home.
				L2: A Scarlet Tigerfish, extracted from the heart of the inferno. Its stripes are like vows branded by flame.
				L3: Holding it, you can feel a scorching resolve. That is the temperature of a true warrior.
				L4: You defeated it, but I suspect... in the moment it fell, it finally found its release.
